# SOAP faults
List of SOAP error code and message when the error or problem occurs.

### Overview
If your SOAP request is successful, the Sponsored Search API will return an HTTP 200 OK response code and the SOAP response. <br> If an error occurs during the processing of your SOAP request, Sponsored Search API will return an error code and message. <br>See [Error](/docs/en/api_reference/data/Common/Error.md), [ErrorDetail](/docs/en/api_reference/data/Common/ErrorDetail.md) for the entity details

### Sample Error Response

There are 3 types of SOAP error response, SAPFault, Full error and Part error. See the following description about each response.

#### SOAPFault

SOAPFault response returns for WSDL violation, SOAP syntax violation, system error and authentication error.<br>
`<faultcode>` describes an error code, and `<faultstring>` describes an error message.<br>
Detail error are described in `<detail>` in some cases.

The following response is an example of SOAPFault in the case of login failure on [AccountService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/AccountService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <SOAP-ENV:Fault>
      <faultcode>0011</faultcode>
      <faultstring>not login for apiAccountId</faultstring>
      <faultactor/>
      <detail>
        <requestKey>apiAccountId</requestKey>
        <requestValue>4581-9911-7326-6030</requestValue>
      </detail>
    </SOAP-ENV:Fault>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

SOAPFault response form depends on API versions. The form above is in case of V201805 version.

#### Full Error

Full Error is returned for the fail of entire request caused by request constraints, etc. It is different from SOAPFault.<br>
Part Error is returned for the request fail caused by constraints in each ‘<operand>’ of SOAP request.

The following response is an example of Full Error in the case of invalid ‘numberResults’ value of `Paging` in [AccountService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/AccountService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://ss.yahooapis.jp/V201805" xmlns:ns2="http://ss.yahooapis.jp/V201805/Account" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <SOAP-ENV:Header>
    <ns2:ResponseHeader>
      <ns1:service>AccountService</ns1:service>
      <ns1:timeTakenSeconds>0.1234</ns1:timeTakenSeconds>
      <ns1:requestTime>1234567890</ns1:requestTime>
    </ns2:ResponseHeader>
  </SOAP-ENV:Header>
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <ns2:getResponse>
      <ns2:error>
        <ns1:code>0007</ns1:code>
        <ns1:message>invalid number format.</ns1:message>
        <ns1:detail>
          <ns1:requestKey>numberResults</ns1:requestKey>
          <ns1:requestValue>1000000</ns1:requestValue>
        </ns1:detail>
      </ns2:error>
    </ns2:getResponse>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

#### Part Error

Part Error is returned in the error case caused by constraints of each element in ‘<operand>’.<br>
Part Error is returned for each ‘<operand>’, whether an error occurred or not.<br>
The error response may contain both of ‘true’ and ‘false’ as value of ‘<operationSucceeded>’, since '<value>' returns for each '<operand>' when you send a single SOAP request which includes multiple ‘<operand>’.

The following response is an example of Part Error in the case of specifying a ‘reportId’ which does not exist in [ReportService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/ReportService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://ss.yahooapis.jp/V201805" xmlns:ns2="http://ss.yahooapis.jp/V201805/Report" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
